# leetcode-rs

my solution to leetcode with rust

## End

LeetCode doesn't support importing HashMap, HashSet, etc.. These are the necessary functionalities for hard problems.

## Problem todo

- q23 is slow.
- q28 API changed, so I didn't do it.
- q30 is slow

## Essence

- if not specified, should get clear if every X appears at least / at most once.

## Rust

`String::match_indices` said `disjoint`

## What does it give?

- Solution to LeetCode problems.
- Simple complexity analyses.
- Convert files VSCE leetcode to meet Rust naming conventions. (`cargo run .`)

## Origin of the solutions?

- Most of the solution, if not specified, is generated by GitHub copilot.
- I ([PabloLION](https://github.com/PabloLION)) try to refactor the solutions to be more readable.
- Some `Solution` have a `fn XXX_pablo`, which is written by me myself. Sometimes there's also a `fn XXX_pablo_copilot`, which is suggested by GitHub Copilot.
- See git blame for more details.

## Thoughts on LeetCode

1. Focusing too much on the executing speed and memory usage rather than the readability.
