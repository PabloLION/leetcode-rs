my solution to leetcode with rust

## Problem todo

- q23 is slow.

## What does it give?

- Solution to LeetCode problems.
- Simple complexity analyses.
- Convert files VSCE leetcode to meet Rust naming conventions. (`cargo run .`)

## Origin of the solutions?

- Most of the solution, if not specified, is generated by GitHub copilot.
- I ([PabloLION](https://github.com/PabloLION)) try to refactor the solutions to be more readable.
- Some `Solution` have a `fn XXX_pablo`, which is written by me myself. Sometimes there's also a `fn XXX_pablo_copilot`, which is suggested by GitHub Copilot.
